# Example scenarios for an organization 🤷
The following are scenarios to support a simple approach to risk found [here](README.md). This is not a checklist. This is a reference to assist someone crafting scenarios to model the risks they would like to measure. 

> These can be modified as much as needed to make sense for a specific organization.

Risk scenarios are hierarchal, like a [fault tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis). High level risks break down into more specific events that initiate them.

Scenarios are variable based on how specific they are and the area they must address. Top level risks set by leadership are usually broad and non-specific scenarios, whereas scenarios managed by a CISO are scoped to technical scenarios, and scenarios approached by individually contributing engineers are far more specific. Engineering efforts that focus on these scenarios will influence the probabilities of higher level scenarios occurring.

All builders and breakers in cybersecurity are manipulating the uncertainties involved with scenarios. They are either reducing the likelihood of a scenario occurring, better understanding the likelihood of them occurring, or understanding how an attacker views these likelihoods differently than yourself.

This is an example of [decomposing risk](https://medium.com/starting-up-security/decomposing-security-risk-into-scenarios-7ecf0979be01).

Shared scenarios have the opportunity for shared discussion. While these scenarios share a likelihood of being relevant to many organizations, they do not necessarily represent the most important risks your organization should be prioritizing. However, information shared regarding these scenarios could be invaluable in prioritizing your risks.

## 1. Top level Risks
Broad, strategic risks typically expressed by a board or C-Suite when asked by a security team. These may not be measured often, but will set high level vision for a security organization.

- A trust issue has threatened investors (_We don't want to hurt stock price_)
- A trust issue has created a press event. (_Keep us out of the press_)
- A trust issue has begun a regulatory / legal event. (_We don't want to get sued_)
- A trust issue has created a loss in customer activity. (_We want to keep customers happy_)
- A trust issue is exacerbated due to a poorly handled response. (_We should never be caught off guard_)
- An executive is removed do to a mishandled trust issue. (_I want to keep my job_)

> Leadership may call out far more specific risks, and that is OK. ("_A warehouse is offline_")

## 2. Scenarios that influence these risks
Risks can be decomposed from top level risks voiced by leadership. These would calibrate a team toward specific issues. Here is an example:

- A trust issue has created a loss in customer activity.
  - Our application was exploited and customer data was exposed.
    - An IDOR was discovered by an adversary and exploited.
    - An RCE was discovered by an adversary and exploited.
    - Our application retrieved objects from the wrong customer's S3 bucket when exporting data.  

## 3. Tasks that influence these risks
With target risks in mind, a team can pursue OKRs to influence the likelihood of information security scenarios occurring. This is well covered in [better OKR's](https://medium.com/@magoo/how-to-measure-risk-with-a-better-okr-c259bccf359e). This approach heavily relies on forecasting.

## Reference Scenarios

### Common scenario modifiers
These are typical additions to help prioritize the most relevant scenarios. They are not typically scenarios themselves, but help focus mitigation efforts to the highest priority problems.

Some scenarios are only important if they are capable of trigger an incident of a certain severity.

> A *P0 incident* has involved...

> A P0 incident has involved an employee who was not off-boarded correctly.

> A P0 incident has resulted because an attacker bypassed rate limiting.

Some bugs might not meet a specific "severity" classification but end up leveraged criminally anyways.

> ...was exploited "*in the wild*"

> An RCE discovered in our software was exploited "in the wild".

> An exploit targeting the configuration of web server we host has been observed in the wild.

The publicity involved with a scenario may be the goal of reduction efforts.

> The *press has disclosed*...

> An employee has leaked confidential data which the press has disclosed.

> We have botched a vulnerability disclosure and the press has disclosed it before we could issue a fix.

A time based scope is always included. Using consistent scopes or calendar based scopes improves everyone's ability to forecast comparable scenarios. "_Next Month_", "_Next Year_", "_Next Quarter_" are all typical.

### IT Management Scenarios 📠
