# A minimalist risk management program.
The smallest documented risk management program using only raw materials, by [@magoo](https://www.twitter.com/magoo).

## :mag: Kick off an effort to discover risks.
Decide on the methods you want to employ to discover risk, and what scope of risks you're interested in. Limit your costs and effort to something reasonable, because an over-investment in risk discovery can harm our available resource to mitigate whatever we find.

> The output of this effort should be an unsorted list of well crafted "scenarios".

## :clipboard: Sort these scenarios based on their risk.
Once your known scenarios are documented, sort them based on risks. Higher likelihood, higher impact risks at the top, and low likelihood, low impact risks at the bottom. A sort based on intuition is fine. You can improve this with multiple participants using a [cumulative point system vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_voting) to reduce bias and increase consensus.

> The output of this effort should be an ordered set of scenarios, high to low.

## :ballot_box_with_check: Choose OKR's that represent mitigations for these risks and pursue them.
Once your risks are prioritized, develop [OKR's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) for the next cycle of mitigation. These should have the greatest intuitive impact on the most high priority risks as possible. A single, well crafted OKR should mitigate multiple risks at once. Choose OKRs that have a [positive influences](https://medium.com/starting-up-security/the-five-factors-used-to-secure-systems-7f58be0f447f) across many risks. Stop focusing on risk management until the cycle of work is complete.

> The output of this effort should be a reduced set of risks.

## :recycle: Start over and do it again.
Risk management is cyclical and iterative. You should always be discovering new risks. You don't have to spend effort re-discovering old ones.

Depending on your mitigation efforts, your sorting should change again, as should your OKR's. Invest in risk management in a proportion that scales with the success and growth of whatever you are protecting.

Eventually aim to make this cycle of discovery, sorting, and mitigation more continuous, with ever increasing efficiency of your discovery and mitigation methods.

### :interrobang: This method checks the boxes, but has weaknesses.
This method is simple mainly for it's lack of measurement, which becomes the biggest problem.

- It's impossible to know if you've discovered enough risks. What is enough?
- While our intuition roughly sort our risks, how much distance exists in between each line item?
- Does our risk discovery process inform an investment into mitigation? How much money should we spend?
- Is our risk mitigation outpacing our increase in risks? Are we losing a race?
- What if we don't have talent or expertise to target the biggest risks?
